# StopSense bus-stop telemetry prototype

A local prototype with a **React + TypeScript frontend**, FastAPI telemetry API, SQLite storage, and a simulated device:

```text
Python simulator → FastAPI /telemetry → SQLite → React + TypeScript (Vite)
```

All device readings and bus arrivals are synthetic unless you connect an approved real data source. The API has no authentication and is intended for local demonstration only; do not expose it to the public internet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ and npm
- Internet access for initial package installation

## Install the backend

From this directory, create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install the backend requirements:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.

## Run the complete demo

Open **three terminals**. Keep each process running while you use the frontend.

**Terminal 1 — FastAPI and SQLite backend** (from this directory, with the Python environment activated):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

Verify at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/health>. API documentation: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.

**Terminal 2 — simulated bus-stop device** (from this directory, with the same Python environment):

```bash
python simulator.py
```

It posts sensor readings every five seconds. Configure `DEVICE_ID`, `TELEMETRY_URL`, and `SEND_INTERVAL_SECONDS` environment variables if needed.

**Terminal 3 — React + TypeScript frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite, usually <http://127.0.0.1:5173>. The Vite development server proxies `/api/*` requests to the FastAPI server at `127.0.0.1:8000`, so no separate CORS configuration is needed for local development. The React page receives telemetry over a live event stream and has three views: passenger app, bus-stop screen, and operations dashboard. Use the header's Dark mode / Light mode control to switch themes across the dashboard; the choice is saved in this browser and initially follows the operating-system preference when no saved choice exists.

If FastAPI or the simulator is unavailable, the frontend shows clearly labelled preview values; it does not mistake these for real sensor data.

### Frontend production build

From `frontend/`:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The development proxy only applies to `npm run dev`. Production builds read `VITE_API_URL` from `frontend/.env.production`, currently set to `https://stopsense.onrender.com`; changing it requires rebuilding and redeploying the static site. The FastAPI app allows browser requests from `https://qiphy.github.io` for its read-only API endpoints. Deploy the updated backend as well as the frontend so the CORS configuration takes effect.

### Solar generation and reference energy use

The dashboard shows illustrative reference load values from the supplied system reference: a 120 W centrifugal fan (assumed 12 h/day), 20 W LED lighting (14 h/day), and 15 W controls + sensors (12 h/day), for a 155 W total rated load and 1.90 kWh/day example consumption. The reference also lists a 0 W gravity-fed pump, 57 kWh/month, 694 kWh/year, RM 315/year at RM 0.454/kWh, and 526 kgCO₂e/year. These are reference assumptions, not site measurements or verified equipment performance.

The reference does **not** provide a separate display wattage: 15 W is labelled “Controls + Sensors” and must not be treated as a confirmed display rating. Solar generation/output is intentionally shown as awaiting panel specifications. Do not infer generation, system sizing, or dimension-based estimates until engineering provides panel specifications and a measurement source.

### Live dashboard updates

The frontend opens a Server-Sent Events connection to `GET /events/telemetry`. The API sends an initial telemetry/passenger-count snapshot and pushes a refreshed snapshot when either ingestion endpoint receives data. EventSource reconnects automatically; bus arrival countdowns continue to update locally each second. The development proxy forwards `/api/events/telemetry` to FastAPI. For a hosted split frontend/backend, set `VITE_API_URL` to the backend base URL and allow the frontend origin in the API CORS configuration.

### Simulated bus arrivals

ETAs are generated in the frontend from example route headways, not live bus GPS. They are labelled simulated in all views. Passenger view includes a hands-free two-ad carousel that slides between time-based sample nearby-shop offers every 15 seconds, expandable shop details, sample walk/bus/alight directions, locally generated QR codes for demo voucher and route links, a location-permission prompt, sample disruption alternatives, and a comparison of fictional e-hailing providers. The non-touchscreen stop display rotates two sample ad slides automatically every 15 seconds, sliding horizontally to reveal the next ad and then returning to the first. Each slide keeps its ad creative, route or promo details, and QR code visible without requiring interaction; the separate journey-alternatives QR was removed to keep this area uncluttered. QR scans reopen the demo app and display a prototype notice; voucher redemption, map navigation and live service data are not integrated. No user location is stored or sent to the API; location access is only requested after the user presses the button. The demo does not use coordinates for routing: even after permission is granted, the sample alternatives are still based on the selected stop until an approved map/transit routing source is integrated.

The disruption control is a local simulation, not a real disruption feed. Alternative bus routes, fare estimates, pickup ETAs and vehicle types are fictional examples. Selecting “continue” does not place an order or contact a provider. Public transport alternatives are shown first; real multi-provider quotes and booking require transit/map feeds and each e-hailing company’s agreement and API integration. Shop names/offers are also fictional and do not imply a partnership. For real arrivals, connect an authorized transit API or GTFS-Realtime feed and report its source and update time. Crowd level means people waiting at the stop, **not occupancy onboard a bus**.

## Shared ESP32/FastAPI payload

The simulator sends this schema to `POST /telemetry`; a future ESP32 can send the same JSON using HTTP POST with `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "device_id": "stop-01",
  "timestamp": "2026-10-19T08:30:00+00:00",
  "temperature_c": 31.2,
  "humidity_pct": 72.0,
  "water_level_pct": 85.0,
  "power_w": 14.6,
  "cooler_on": true,
  "crowd_level": "Moderate",
  "crowd_source": "simulated",
  "fault_code": null
}
```

The API validates values and returns HTTP `201` for accepted data or `422` for invalid fields. `crowd_level` accepts `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`, or `Unknown`; `crowd_source` identifies `simulated`, `manual`, `sensor`, `operator`, or `unknown` data; omitted sources default to `unknown`. Read recent records at `GET /telemetry?limit=200`; filter by device with `GET /telemetry?device_id=stop-01`.

For real deployment, only report a stop crowd level from a verified source (for example manual observation or an approved people-counting sensor), with a timestamp and source label. GPS on buses does not provide occupancy. The local doorway counter below estimates onboard occupancy from observed crossings; it does not measure the waiting crowd and is not a substitute for a validated passenger-counting system.

### Local doorway passenger counter (boarding/alighting/occupancy)

The Operations view keeps the StopSense dashboard and telemetry intact and provides setup instructions for the local Python counter. Detection and tracking use Ultralytics YOLOv8n and ByteTrack on the camera host; the browser does not capture video or run a separate detector. Only aggregate reports are posted to `POST /passenger-counts`, and the latest report for each camera appears in Operations. The optional `bus_route` field associates a camera report with a sample route and is retained by the API.

On the computer connected to the camera, install the optional camera dependencies from the StopSense project root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-camera.txt
```

Start FastAPI in one terminal:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

In a second terminal on that host, run the counter (choose the route in the Operations setup panel and pass the same route here):

```bash
python bus_counter.py --source 0 --camera-id bus-door-01 --bus-route T1 --axis y --line 0.55 --in-direction down
```

For a side-on view, use `--axis x --in-direction right`; change the direction if necessary and validate it with a short test. Adjust `--line` to the camera view. Use `--source path/to/video.mp4` for a recorded test or `--source URL` for a camera stream. Configure the model with `--model` (default `yolov8n.pt`), detection threshold with `--confidence`, tracker with `--tracker` (default `bytetrack.yaml`), and line-jitter tolerance with `--hysteresis`. The model weights download on first run unless a local model path is supplied. Set `--initial-occupancy N` to seed an area that is not empty. Crossing safeguards can be tuned with `--min-displacement`, `--min-track-frames`, and `--crossing-cooldown`. `--api-url ""` disables publishing and `--no-display` runs headlessly. `PASSENGER_COUNT_API_URL`, `PASSENGER_CAMERA_ID`, `PASSENGER_BUS_ROUTE`, and `PASSENGER_MODEL` can also configure these values.

Frames are processed locally and never uploaded. The API stores the latest aggregate report per camera; boarding, alighting, and occupancy values are cumulative/estimated for that counter process. Reports marked `ok` are shown as stale after 30 seconds without an update. Detector confidence is the mean model score for counted crossings, not calibrated counting accuracy. The passenger view may display the latest route-associated onboard occupancy estimate; it is not an estimate of the people waiting at the stop and does not account for people already onboard unless the initial occupancy is set appropriately.

Stop waiting-area crowd telemetry remains its own data path (`crowd_level`/`crowd_source`) and must come from an appropriate stop-side source. Bus doorway crossings do not measure people waiting at the stop, and occupancy can drift due to missed detections, track swaps, or unobserved entry/exit. This is a prototype, not certified passenger-counting equipment. Validate and tune the model, line, direction, and tracking on the actual camera angle; only use camera footage with operator approval, appropriate notices/consent, and a privacy review. Do not use facial recognition or retain identifiable footage.

The API accepts aggregate reports at `POST /passenger-counts`; `occupancy_count` remains nullable for older counter clients, and `bus_route` is optional. Retrieve reports with `GET /passenger-counts` or filter with `GET /passenger-counts?camera_id=bus-door-01`.

Validate crossing logic without a camera or optional CV packages:

```bash
python bus_counter.py --self-test
python -m unittest test_passenger_counts.py
```

By default, the SQLite file is `telemetry.db` in the current directory. Set `TELEMETRY_DB` to change its path.

## Moving from simulation to ESP32

Keep the FastAPI payload contract unchanged. First test a real device on a trusted local network and point it at the computer's LAN address, e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:8000/telemetry` (not `localhost`, which would refer to the ESP32 itself). For deployment, add device authentication, HTTPS with certificate validation, access control, retention limits, and robust offline buffering. Keep safety-critical cooling control on the ESP32; the dashboard/server should monitor it, not be required for safe operation.
